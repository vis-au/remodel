# Overview

ReVize is a library for visualization toolchaining with Vega-Lite.

It provides wrapper functions to the [Vega-Lite grammar](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite) for adding import and export functionality to existing web-based visualization tools.
Thus, ReVize enables visualization toolchaining by using multiple visualization tools in concert through a shared exchange format.
